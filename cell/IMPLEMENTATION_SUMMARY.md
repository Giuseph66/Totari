# Totari Mobile App - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Totari mobile application, which allows users to record audio messages, upload them directly to Firebase Storage, and view processed transcripts and improvements in a chat interface.

**Note: This implementation has been updated to use Firebase Storage instead of a backend API. See FIREBASE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for details.**

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication
- Local user management with device ID persistence
- Session persistence across app restarts
- Logout functionality

### 2. Audio Recording
- Audio recording with expo-av (AAC .m4a, 48 kHz, mono)
- Recording duration tracking
- File size validation (max 25MB)
- Recording time limit (max 20 minutes)

### 3. File Upload
- Direct upload to Firebase Storage
- Automatic transcription with ElevenLabs STT
- Transcript storage in Firebase Storage

### 4. Thread Management
- Create new threads
- List existing threads
- Local storage of threads

### 5. Chat Interface
- Timeline view of messages in chat format
- Different message bubble types:
  - Audio messages with embedded player
  - Transcript messages with copy functionality
  - Improvement messages with structured content (improved text, topics, insights, summary)
- Polling for real-time updates (5-second interval)
- Auto-scroll to bottom when new messages arrive

### 6. Message Components
- Audio player with play/pause and progress tracking
- Message bubbles with appropriate styling for each message type
- Timestamps and relative time formatting
- Copy to clipboard functionality

### 7. State Management
- Authentication state with Zustand
- Thread state management
- Device ID persistence with expo-secure-store

### 8. Firebase Integration
- Direct Firebase Storage operations
- ElevenLabs STT integration (DEV ONLY - use proxy in production)

### 9. Utilities
- Time formatting utilities
- File size validation
- Clipboard integration
- Device ID management

## Project Structure

  /stores       # State management with Zustand
  /types        # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils        # Utility functions

/app            # Application screens and routing
  /auth         # Authentication screens
  /(tabs)       # Tab-based navigation
  /chat         # Chat thread screens

/__tests__      # Test files
  /components   # Component tests
  /stores       # Store tests
  /utils        # Utility tests

## Technical Details

### Libraries Used
- **expo-av**: Audio recording and playback
- **expo-secure-store**: Secure device ID storage
- **firebase**: Firebase Storage integration
- **axios**: HTTP client for ElevenLabs API
- **zustand**: State management
- **expo-router**: Navigation and routing

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates (local device ID)
2. User creates or selects a thread
3. User records audio message
4. File is uploaded directly to Firebase Storage
5. Audio is transcribed with ElevenLabs STT
6. Transcript is saved to Firebase Storage
7. App polls Firebase Storage for updates
8. Messages are displayed in real-time in the chat view

### Error Handling
- File size validation
- Recording time limits
- User-friendly error messages
- Network error handling

## Security
- Device ID stored securely using expo-secure-store
- ElevenLabs API key in environment variables (DEV ONLY)
- HTTPS communication with Firebase
- **Production deployment requires backend proxy for ElevenLabs API**

## Development vs Production
### Development
- Direct ElevenLabs API calls from mobile
- API key in environment variables

### Production (Required)
- Implement backend proxy for ElevenLabs calls
- Remove API key from client
- Update code to use proxy instead of direct API calls

This implementation provides a complete foundation for the Totari mobile application using Firebase Storage with all requested features and a clean, maintainable codebase.
